# Getting started

## Environment

Currently, there is just one dependency: **nodejs**. Download and install an appropriate version: [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/#download)

## Deploy

Go to the [Releases page on github](https://github.com/maxkoryukov/tndr/releases) and download the appropriate **zip**-release (in most cases - the latest release). Then unzip it to the preffered installation folder.

You are on the right way!

Now, we going to install required NPM-packages: open a terminal application for your OS, and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

**DONE** :octocat:, tndr installed!

## Run

Time to run the application:

```
npm start
```

The application will try to open your default browser (if no: open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
By default, the app will create default user:

* Username : **root**
* Password : **123**

** DO NOT FORGET TO [CHANGE DEFAULT PASSWORD AFTER LOGIN](http://localhost:3000/users/me)**

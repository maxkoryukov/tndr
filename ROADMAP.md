# ROADMAP

## Preparation

* [x] **GITHUB** Choose repo (GitHub vs. BitBucket). I prefer GitHub (a lot of integration stuff, **releases**, and other tasty features). Bitbucket has just two advantages : there is one old project, and there are opportunity to use **free private** repositories.
* [x] **NODEJS** Choose platform. My choice - **node.js** (javascript) + sqlite.

# Roadmap

_Roadmap is not 100% detailed, currently, just basic steps._

## Preparation

* [x] **GITHUB** Choose repo (GitHub vs. BitBucket). I prefer GitHub (a lot of integration stuff, **releases**, and other tasty features). Bitbucket has just two advantages : there is one old project, and there are opportunity to use **free private** repositories.
* [x] **NODEJS** Choose platform. My choice - **node.js** (javascript) + sqlite.

## Milestone 1: DataStructure Scaffold

**2016-02-29**

* [ ] desribe data structures for main entities
* [ ] Describe the decomposition of project to submodules

Next steps - are waiting for decomposition..

Base approach for each module:

* [ ] tests
* [ ] code
